# About the Event
In the true spirit of open source, volunteers are essential. IEEE SA OPEN both recognizes and celebrates contributions made by subject matter experts who help projects and communities thrive in open source. This event is to foster creativity and leadership as we launch advisory groups in marketing, community, and technical application for projects and communities on the IEEE SA OPEN platform. We understand the importance of diversity in all areas, including role diversity and the part it plays in generating the future of stronger open source communities. Join us in shaping the next generation of open source by becoming a volunteer. Work with us to give back to the community and strengthen humanitarian efforts.
